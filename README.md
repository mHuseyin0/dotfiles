# My dotfiles and configs.

- I got many of them from Chris Titus Tech and then modified as I need.

- Do not execute setup script without reading. (It includes installing yay.)

- Dotfiles belong to home directory while starship.toml and other directories needs to be in ~/.config. And txt files are just information that I want to remember.
